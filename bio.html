          Taken near Kokhana, the first picture closely resembles the majority of streets in Kathmandu Valley, with the same narrow road and houses at either side of them. On the right, there is a small temple along which we can see a road leading up to another street.
          The 2nd picture depicts the gentle slopy hills of Kokhana. There are only a few houses, indicating that the population is thin. Various terraces are seen to be developed for the sole purpose of farming.
          Captured in Sekha, the 3rd picture is mainly focused on the hills which have been made into terraces. The lightning was added as an after effect to give the picture a dark and gloomy look.
          The 4th picture is a beautiful portrayal of a lingering sunset in the hills of Chardhara. The rays escaping through the clouds add more warmth to the picture, making it scenically beautiful.
          The 5th picture was taken at the time of sunset. It was captured to look like the sun is being held between the fingers which gives the picture an artistic look.
          The 6th picture was taken in Siddhapokhari, a beautiful pond located in the midst of Bhaktapur. The pond is surrounded by lush green trees, giving the atmostphere a peaceful setting.
